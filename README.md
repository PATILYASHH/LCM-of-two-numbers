# GCD and LCM Calculator

This C program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers entered by the user.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program:** Use any C compiler to compile the program. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc gcd_lcm.c -o gcd_lcm
2. Run the Program: Execute the compiled program. For example:

```
3. Enter Values: Follow the prompts to enter the values of `a` and `b`.

4. View Results: The program will display the GCD and LCM of the entered numbers.

## Sample Output
```
Enter value of a: 24
Enter value of b: 36
GCD of 24 and 36 is 12
LCM of 24 and 36 is 72
```
